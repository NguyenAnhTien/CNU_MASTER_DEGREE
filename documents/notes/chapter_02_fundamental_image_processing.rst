Structure of the Human Eye
--------------------------
The eye is nearly a sphere, with an average diameter of approximately 20 mm.
There membrances enclose the eye: the cornea and sclera outer cover; the
choroid; and the retina.

The cornea is a tough, transparent tissue that covers the anterior surface of 
the eye.
The sclera is an opaque membrance that encloses the remainder of the optic 
globe.
The choroid contains a network of blood vessels that serve as the major source
of nutrition to the eye.
The choroid coat is heavily pigmented and hence helps to reduce the amount of
extraneous light entering the eye. At its anterior extreme, the choroid is
divided into the ciliary body and the iris. 
The central opening of the iris (the pupil) varies in diameter from 
approximately  2 to 8 mm. The front of the iris contains the visible pigment 
of the eye, whereas the back contains a black pigment.
